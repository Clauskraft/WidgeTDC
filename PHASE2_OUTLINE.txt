END OF PHASE 2 OUTLINE
================================================================================
Status: DRAFT (Pending Phase 1 completion)
Last Updated: 2025-11-16 18:23 UTC
Authority: System Director (Claus)

================================================================================
PHASE 2 BACKEND PLATFORM INFRASTRUCTURE (NEW TRACK 2.C)
================================================================================
Added: 2025-11-16 18:30 UTC (from existing branches held for Phase 2)

TRACK 2.C: Backend Platform Services (PARALLEL with 2.A and 2.B)
PURPOSE: Build platform infrastructure foundation for core widgets

BRANCHES CONTAINING THIS WORK:
  - copilot/sub-pr-14 (PlatformProvider + contracts)
  - copilot/sub-pr-14-one-more-time (Platform services + logging)
  - copilot/sub-pr-14-yet-again (WidgetComponentProps types)

IMPLEMENTATION COMPONENTS:

2.C.1: PlatformProvider & Context
  Files: src/platform/core/PlatformProvider.tsx, PlatformContext.ts
  Purpose: React Context wrapper providing platform services to widgets
  Effort: 3-5 days
  Owner: Backend Architect (NEW ROLE recommended)

2.C.2: Service Implementations
  Files: src/domain/*, src/platform/*/InMemory*Service.ts
  Services:
    - SecurityOverwatchService (security operations)
    - AuditLogService (event logging)
    - VectorStoreAdapter (vector DB)
    - ProcurementIntelligenceService (procurement logic)
    - NotesAggregatorService (notes backend)
  Effort: 10-12 days
  Owner: Backend Architect + Backend team

2.C.3: Type System & Integration
  Files: src/platform/widgets/types.ts, WidgetComponentProps
  Purpose: Strong typing between widgets and services
  Effort: 3-4 days
  Owner: Chief Architect

2.C.4: Logging & Monitoring
  Files: utils/logger.ts, service logging integration
  Purpose: Replace console.* with proper logging service
  Effort: 2-3 days
  Owner: Backend team

TOTAL EFFORT (TRACK 2.C): 18-24 days (3-4 weeks parallel)

PHASE 2 REVISED STRUCTURE:

  Track 2.A: Core Widget Enterprise Upgrade (32-44 days)
  Track 2.B: Security Intelligence Widgets (23-29 days)
  Track 2.C: Backend Platform Infrastructure (18-24 days) [NEW]
  
  Total: 73-97 days of work compressed to 8 weeks (parallel execution)

PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY:
  - Track 2.A: Frontend engineers (UI widget upgrades)
  - Track 2.B: Frontend + Backend (Security widgets UI + backend)
  - Track 2.C: Backend engineers (Platform infrastructure)
  
  All three tracks run simultaneously Jan 1 - Feb 28

DEPENDENCIES:
  Track 2.A → Track 2.C: Widgets need platform services
  Track 2.B → Track 2.C: Security widgets need audit/logging
  Track 2.C is foundational: Must complete or integrate with other tracks

TIMELINE IMPACT:
  - If all 3 tracks work in parallel: 8 weeks remains realistic
  - If Track 2.C slips: Blocks widget implementation
  - Recommendation: Assign dedicated backend team to Track 2.C

TEAM REQUIREMENT FOR PHASE 2 (UPDATED):
  Track 2.A: 2-3 Frontend engineers (React)
  Track 2.B: 1-2 Frontend + 1 Backend (security integration)
  Track 2.C: 1-2 Backend engineers (platform infrastructure) [NEW]
  
  Total: 4-6 engineers minimum
  Current: 1 Chief Architect + 1 Chief GUI Designer
  
  RECOMMENDATION: Hire 2-3 specialists (confirmed in Interview #2)
