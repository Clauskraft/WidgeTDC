  2. Release Manager logs in BACKLOG.txt
  3. Classified: Category, Phase, Priority
  4. Dependencies identified
  5. Rough estimate provided
  6. NOT added to Phase 1 (scope discipline)

PHASE PLANNING PROCESS:
  1. At end of Phase N, review backlog for Phase N+1

BACKLOG-11: 🚀 10 EARTH-ROCKING INPUTS - WidgetTDC System Architecture Review
================================================================================
CATEGORY: Strategic Architecture
SOURCE: System architect comprehensive review
PHASE: Phase 1.C-2 boundary (Dec 16-31, 2025 planning phase)
PRIORITY: CRITICAL (foundation for scale and production readiness)

DESCRIPTION:
  Comprehensive architecture review addressing 10 critical system insights:
  MCP foundation strategy, multi-service agent patterns, database scaling,
  prompt evolution safeguards, authentication/multi-tenancy, vector search
  optimization, type safety, WebSocket reliability, testing/observability,
  and UI state synchronization.

CRITICAL INSIGHTS:

1. ⚙️ MCP as Architectural Foundation
   - Standardized inter-component messaging layer
   - Future-proof widget/service decoupling
   - Creates competitive moat through documented API specs
   - Action: Formalize MCP contracts as official API specifications

2. 🧠 Multi-Service AI Agent Architecture
   - 5 specialized services need unified orchestration layer
   - Risk: Overlapping concerns and duplicated memory management
   - Solution: AI Agent Factory + cross-service message broker
   - Ownership: Define clear memory persistence responsibility

3. 💾 SQLite Bottleneck (CRITICAL)
   - Current: 11 SQLite tables insufficient for production scale
   - Issue: Vector embeddings (10M+) + concurrent writes
   - Solution: Dual-write pattern (SQLite dev → PostgreSQL + pgvector prod)
   - Timeline: Implement migration tooling before data explosion
   - Impact: Blocks production deployment if not addressed

4. 🔄 Evolution & KPI Monitor - Automatic Prompt Refinement
   - Strength: Self-evolving agents (rare capability)
   - Risk: Prompt drift without guardrails = quality degradation
   - Mitigation: Add Quality Gates (KPI thresholds, A/B testing, rollback)

5. 🔐 Authentication & Multi-Tenancy (MISSING FOUNDATION)
   - Current: No visible auth layer or tenant isolation
   - Critical Gap: Have memory/RAG/KPI data but no security boundaries
   - Must-Have: JWT/OAuth2 + row-level security + audit logging
   - Blocks: Production deployment, enterprise contracts

6. 📊 SRAG Architecture - Vector Search Latency Trap
   - Current: NL → SQL → semantic search = N+1 latency
   - Optimization: Cached query plans + query cost estimator + approximate NN
   - Expected improvement: 3-5x response time reduction

7. 🎯 Frontend-Backend Contract - Type Safety Breakthrough
   - Strength: Shared TypeScript + MCP interfaces
   - Enhancement: Add Zod/io-ts runtime validation
   - Add: OpenAPI/GraphQL layer for external consumers
   - Add: Version MCP with backward compatibility tests

8. ⚡ WebSocket Architecture - Real-time Reliability
   - Current: WebSocket for widget-service communication
   - Gaps: Message ordering, reconnection logic, backpressure?
   - Solution: Message queue (Redis/RabbitMQ) + circuit breakers + replay

9. 🧪 Testing & Observability (BLIND SPOT)
   - Current: 15+ widgets + 5 services but missing end-to-end coverage
   - Add: E2E tests per AI workflow
   - Add: Performance benchmarks
   - Add: Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
   - Add: Agent decision audit trail (compliance + debugging)

10. 🎭 UI State Management + AI State Sync
    - Risk: Widget state diverges from AI Agent state during long operations
    - Solution: Optimistic Updates + Rollback Pattern
    - Add: Conflict resolution for concurrent user + AI actions

DEPENDENCIES:
  - Phase 1.B complete (Dec 15)
  - Phase 1.C component system (Dec 20)
  - Phase 1 quality gate passed (Dec 31)

CRITICAL PATH ITEMS (MUST DO):
  🔴 CRITICAL:
     - Database migration plan (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
     - Multi-tenancy + authentication integration
     - Production readiness audit

  🟠 HIGH:
     - Message queue + circuit breakers
     - End-to-end test suite + observability
     - Query optimization for SRAG

  🟡 MEDIUM:
     - Prompt evolution guardrails
     - WebSocket reliability enhancements
     - UI state synchronization patterns

ESTIMATED EFFORT:
  Phase 1.C planning: 2-3 days (Dec 25-31)
  Phase 2 execution: 3-4 weeks (concurrent with Phase 2.A/B/C)
  Impact: Unblocks production deployment + enterprise scaling

NOTES:
  - This is NOT Phase 1 work (scope discipline)
  - This IS foundation for Phase 2+ success
  - Database migration must start before data explosion
  - Auth/multi-tenancy prerequisite for production launch
  - Observability critical for multi-service debugging
