## ⚠️ RISK DASHBOARD

### Current Risks (Ranked by Impact × Probability)

**Risk 1: MCP Platform Architect Availability** (MEDIUM × MEDIUM = MEDIUM)

```
Probability: 40%
Impact:      Could delay MCP Foundation by 1-2 weeks
Mitigation:
├─ Early search start (Nov 18, tomorrow)
├─ Specialized consulting firms engaged
├─ Premium rate authorized (€120K ceiling)
└─ Fallback: Senior contractor from bench
```

**Risk 2: Recruitment Competition** (MEDIUM × LOW = LOW-MEDIUM)

```
Probability: 30%
Impact:      Could extend search by 3-5 days
Mitigation:
├─ Premium rates authorized
├─ Fast decision-making (same-day offers)
├─ Enterprise scope attractive to candidates
└─ Multiple agencies engaged simultaneously
```

**Risk 3: Budget Approval Delay** (LOW × MEDIUM = LOW)

```
Probability: 20%
Impact:      Could delay non-critical hires by 1 week
Mitigation:
├─ ROI deck ready (10-40x return)
├─ System Director escalation path ready
├─ Can proceed with critical 3 only (€240-360K)
└─ Finance meeting scheduled Wed Nov 20
```

**Risk 4: Database Migration Complexity** (LOW × HIGH = MEDIUM)

```
Probability: 25%
Impact:      Could delay Phase 2 start by 1-2 weeks
Mitigation:
├─ Senior PostgreSQL expert hired (starts Nov 20)
├─ 4-week timeline (Dec 1-31) includes buffer
├─ Dual-write pattern limits risk
└─ Fallback: Launch Phase 2 with SQLite, migrate in parallel
```

### Overall Risk Posture

```
Risk Level:     MEDIUM (down from MEDIUM-HIGH)
Trend:          🔽 DECREASING
Most Critical:  MCP Platform Architect availability
Mitigation:     All risks have active mitigation plans
```

---

## 💡 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Recommendation 1: Pre-Authorize Critical 3 (€240-360K)

```
Rationale:
├─ Accelerates recruitment (no Finance wait)
├─ Shows candidates we're serious (fast offers)
├─ Reduces timeline risk (start Nov 20 guaranteed)
└─ Full budget approval follows Wed Nov 20

Action Required: System Director pre-authorizes €240-360K today
Timeline Impact: -0 days (maintains current timeline)
Risk Reduction:  Budget approval risk → 0%
```

### Recommendation 2: MCP Platform Architect - Early Search Start

```
Rationale:
├─ Niche expertise (distributed systems + protocol design)
├─ Strategic importance (competitive moat)
├─ Longer search expected (2-3 weeks vs 2-3 days)
└─ Early start = more candidates = better quality

Action Required: Contact specialized consulting firms today (Nov 17)
Timeline Impact: +3-5 days candidate pool, +15% quality
Risk Reduction:  MCP availability risk → 25% (from 40%)
```

### Recommendation 3: Staggered Phase 2 Launch (OPTIONAL)

```
Rationale:
├─ Allows critical infrastructure to mature
├─ Reduces pressure on specialists (ramp-up time)
├─ Better quality vs speed trade-off
└─ Minimal timeline impact

Proposal:
├─ Track 2.A: Start Jan 1 (as planned)
├─ Track 2.B: Start Jan 8 (+1 week)
└─ Track 2.C: Start Jan 15 (+2 weeks)

Timeline Impact: +0 to +1 week overall (parallel execution)
Risk Reduction:  Quality gate failure risk → 10% (from 25%)
Confidence:      Phase 2 confidence → 85% (from 80%)
```
