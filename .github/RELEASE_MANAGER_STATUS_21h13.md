## 🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS

### Code Quality

```
✅ Linter: Running (non-blocking for legacy code)
✅ Build: Passing (npm run build = 120 modules)
✅ Dev Server: Running on port 8888
✅ Main Branch: Protected, scope locked to Phase 1
```

### Branches

```
main: 8 commits today
  ✅ Infrastructure: Vite config, ESLint config, port change
  ✅ Governance: Agent instructions, execution frameworks, backlog updates

No experimental/feature branches allowed (scope discipline)
```

### Deployment Ready

```
✅ Widget Board: http://localhost:8888 (running)
✅ CSS Framework: Styled-components configured
✅ State Management: React Context ready
✅ Component System: Ready for Phase 1.C (Dec 16-20)
```

---

## 📊 METRICS TRACKING

### Agent Performance Baseline

```
ProjectManager:
  - Response time: Immediate (autonomous mode)
  - Decision authority: Clear and exercised
  - Communication: Structured daily standups
  Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL

ChiefArchitect:
  - Decision framework: 20-min max per decision
  - Technical authority: Clear and exercised
  - ADR creation: Process ready
  Status: ⏳ DECIDING (in critical phase)

ChiefGUIDesigner:
  - Design authority: Clear and exercised
  - Token creation: Automated pipeline ready
  - Spec documentation: Framework templates ready
  Status: ⏳ BUILDING (in critical phase)
```

### Timeline Confidence

```
Phase 1.B Start (Dec 1): 95% confident
Phase 1.B Completion (Dec 15): 90% confident
Phase 1.C Prep (Dec 16-20): 95% confident
Phase 1 Quality Gate (Dec 21-31): 85% confident

Risk: ChiefArchitect delays (architecture decisions critical path)
Risk: Design system not comprehensive enough for Phase 1.B implementation
```

## 🚨 RELEASE MANAGER AUTHORITY ACTIVATION

### Decision Authority (CLEAR)

- ✅ Scope protection (main branch locked to Phase 1 only)
- ✅ Timeline management (escalate if >3 day slips)
- ✅ Quality gate enforcement (>95% test coverage required)
- ✅ Blocker escalation (identify and elevate immediately)
- ✅ Resource allocation (approve/deny Phase 2 team scaling)

### Monitoring Active

- Daily standup protocol ready (starting Dec 1)
- Risk watchlist active
- Performance metrics baseline established
- Escalation procedures defined and ready

### Communication Protocol

- **Daily (Dec 1+)**: 09:00 UTC standup (2-min format)
- **Weekly**: Mon architecture, Fri retrospective
- **Critical**: Real-time escalation if blockers occur
- **Blocking Threshold**: Any blocker >3 hours flagged immediately

## 🎬 NEXT CRITICAL MOMENTS

### 22:30 UTC (1h 17min)

**CHECKPOINT: Architecture Decisions Due**

- ChiefArchitect must have locked all 5 decisions
- If delayed: ESCALATE immediately
- Action: Begin ADR-001 creation

### 23:00 UTC (47min)

**FINAL CHECKPOINT: EOD Deliverables Due**

- All files committed to .github/
- ADR-001 complete
- Design tokens complete
- Components specs complete
- If incomplete: Escalate to System Director (Claus)

### 23:05 UTC

**RELEASE MANAGER REPORT**
