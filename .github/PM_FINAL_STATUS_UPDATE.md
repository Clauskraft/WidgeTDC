## 🔧 MCP FOUNDATION HIGHLIGHTS

### Why MCP Foundation is Superior to Message Queue

**Technical Advantages**:

- ✓ Solves ALL Gap #4 issues (ordering, reconnection, backpressure, replay)
- ✓ Type safety end-to-end (JSON schema + Zod + TypeScript)
- ✓ Lower operational overhead (Node.js/TypeScript vs Redis/RabbitMQ)
- ✓ Builds on existing stack (no new infrastructure dependencies)

**Strategic Advantages**:

- ✓ Standardized widget protocol = **competitive moat**
- ✓ Contract registry = **developer ecosystem foundation**
- ✓ Future-proof architecture = **plugin system, versioning**
- ✓ Type-safe SDK generation = **easier 3rd-party development**

**Financial Impact**:

- Cost: €86-132K (vs €68-110K for message queue)
- Increase: +€18-22K (+21-26%)
- Strategic ROI: **5-10x** (platform foundation vs commodity infrastructure)

**From BACKLOG-11, Item 1**:

```
MCP as Architectural Foundation
├─ Standardized inter-component messaging layer
├─ Future-proof widget/service decoupling
├─ Creates competitive moat through documented API specs
└─ Action: Formalize MCP contracts as official API specifications
```
