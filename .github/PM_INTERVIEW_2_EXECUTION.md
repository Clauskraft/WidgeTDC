□ Architecture readiness (decisions locked in?)
□ Design system readiness (tokens ready?)
□ Any blockers preventing Dec 1 launch

System Director responds:
□ YES, proceed with current team
□ NO, need [specific resources/decisions]
□ CONDITIONAL, if we [specific actions] by [date]

Decision: PROCEED / HOLD / CONDITIONAL
```

### SECTION B: PHASE 2 TEAM SCALING (15 minutes)
**Topic**: What team do we need for Phase 2.A/B/C?

```
PHASE 2 STRUCTURE:
- Track 2.A: Core Widgets (Calendar, Notes, Status, Procurement, Security)
  Effort: 32-44 days | Team: 2-3 Frontend engineers

- Track 2.B: Security Intelligence (Feed, Search, Activity Stream)
  Effort: 23-29 days | Team: 1-2 Frontend + 1 Backend

- Track 2.C: Backend Platform (Services, logging, types)
  Effort: 18-24 days | Team: 1-2 Backend engineers (NEW ROLE NEEDED)

TOTAL PARALLEL: 3 tracks = 4-6 engineers needed (currently: 1 PM + 1 Arch + 1 Designer)

Questions for System Director:

3. "Should we onboard team in December before Phase 2 kickoff?"
4. "Budget impact for Phase 2 team expansion - acceptable?"
5. "Timeline confidence with team of [X] people?"

PM Recommendation Framework:
IF Phase 1.B complete by Dec 15 + team ready:
  → HIRE: 2-3 specialists in December (Backend Architect, Frontend specialists)
  → START: Phase 2 onboarding Dec 16-31
  → LAUNCH: Phase 2 at full speed Jan 1

IF Phase 1.B slips past Dec 15:
  → DELAY: Phase 2 start to Feb 1
  → ADJUST: Phase 2 timeline or scope
  → ESCALATE: Budget/timeline impact to System Director
```

### SECTION C: AGENT PERFORMANCE (5 minutes)
**Topic**: Are agents working at full speed?

```
PM Assessment:
□ Decision turnaround time: [days/hours] (target: same-day max)
□ Authority clarity: Clear / Somewhat clear / Unclear

□ Burnout risk? [Level: None/Low/Medium/High]
```

### SECTION D: NEXT STEPS (2 minutes)
**Topic**: Confirm execution plan

```
Decisions to Make:
1. Phase 1.B launch: Dec 1 CONFIRMED or adjusted?
2. Phase 2 team size: [Number] engineers to hire?
3. Hiring timeline: NOW or December?
4. Interview #3 schedule: [Date/Time] for progress check

Output: Clear next steps with dates and decision authority
