## 🚨 RISK & BLOCKER TRACKING

### POTENTIAL BLOCKERS (Monitor Closely)

| Risk                                   | Severity  | Probability | Mitigation                               |
| -------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Architect decisions delayed past EOD   | 🔴 HIGH   | Medium      | Escalate by 22:00 UTC if not progressing |
| Design tokens not committed by EOD     | 🔴 HIGH   | Low         | CSS is simple - designer on track        |
| Phase 1.B team not confirmed available | 🟡 MEDIUM | Medium      | Assess in Interview #2 at 18:50          |
| Frontend dev starts without decisions  | 🔴 HIGH   | Low         | Decisions locked today before Dec 1      |

### ESCALATION WATCHLIST

- ⏳ If any EOD deliverable not committed by 22:00 UTC → Escalate to System Director
- ⏳ If Interview #2 decisions unclear → Flag for follow-up call
- ⏳ If Phase 1.B timeline pushed past Dec 1 → Reassess Phase 2 planning

## 📊 AGENT PERFORMANCE METRICS (Baseline)

### Decision Speed

```
Target: <1 day per decision
Baseline (today): Architect making 5 decisions by EOD (12-hour turnaround)
Assessment: ✅ EXCEEDING TARGET - Same day decisions

Expected by Dec 1:
- Architecture decisions: Within 4 hours typical
- Design approval: Within 8 hours typical
- Resource allocation: Within 24 hours typical
```

### Authority Clarity

```
Measured by: Escalations needed per decision
Target: <10% escalated (90% decisions within authority)
Baseline: Setting today
Goal: Establish culture where agents decide without asking permission
```

### Communication Effectiveness

```
Measured by: Clarification questions per spec
Target: <3 clarification questions per component
Baseline: Setting as designers/architects begin handoff
Goal: Specs are so clear developers ask zero questions
```

## 🎯 RELEASE MANAGER AUTHORITY & DECISIONS

### SCOPE PROTECTION (Non-negotiable)

```
✅ Main branch: LOCKED to Phase 1 only
✅ PR flow control: Max 3 concurrent PRs (2-hour review max)
✅ Scope creep: ZERO tolerance - reject scope additions
✅ Backlog discipline: Everything outside Phase 1 → Backlog

If scope creep detected:
1. Block the PR
2. Escalate to System Director
3. Get final decision on priority
4. Document decision in DECISION_LOG.txt
```

### TIMELINE PROTECTION (Flexible within constraints)

```
Phase 1.B: Dec 1-15 (15 days)
Phase 1.C: Dec 16-20 (5 days)
Phase 1 Gate: Dec 21-31 (11 days)

If timeline slips >3 days:
1. Assess impact (resource, decision, quality issue?)
2. Escalate to PM for mitigation
3. If PM can't fix: Escalate to System Director
4. Document mitigation in DECISION_LOG.txt
5. Adjust Phase 1 gate if needed
```

### QUALITY GATE (Must maintain standards)

```
Dec 1-15: Build Phase 1.B features
Dec 21-31: Security audit + architecture review

Quality standards (non-negotiable):
- >95% test coverage for core features
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance: 100%
- Performance targets: <2s load, <100ms interactions
- Zero critical security issues
- Zero critical bugs

If quality slips:
1. Pause feature work
2. Fix quality issues
3. Re-test thoroughly
4. Continue only when quality restored
```
