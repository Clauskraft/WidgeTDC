SYSTEM DIRECTOR STRATEGIC GUIDANCE (2025-11-16 18:24)
================================================================================

DECISION: Agent Scaling Consideration for Phase 2
STATUS: GUIDANCE PROVIDED
AUTHORITY: System Director (Claus)
DIRECTION: Ask PM to consider scaling up agents for Phase 2

RATIONALE:
  Phase 2 complexity:
    - Parallel Track 2.A (Core widgets) + Track 2.B (Security widgets)
    - 32-44 days (Track 2.A) + 23-29 days (Track 2.B) = 55-73 days content
    - Compressed to 8 weeks calendar time (high parallelization needed)
    - Current Chief Architect + Chief GUI Designer may need specialists

AGENT SCALING SUGGESTION:
  Phase 1 Structure:
    - 1 ProjectManager (timeline, budget, resources)
    - 1 ChiefArchitect (technical decisions)
    - 1 ChiefGUIDesigner (UI/UX design)

  Phase 2 Consideration:
    - Keep: ProjectManager, ChiefArchitect, ChiefGUIDesigner
    - ADD: Backend Architect specialist (OpenSearch, database design)
    - ADD: Frontend Specialist (React component performance)
    - ADD: Security Specialist (Cyberstreams integration, audit)
    - CONSIDER: DevOps specialist (infrastructure, deployment)

DECISION:
  Release Manager will nudge PM at next interview to explore:
    1. Can current team handle Phase 2 parallelization?
    2. If not, which specialists needed?
    3. Resource timeline for bringing new agents online
    4. Knowledge transfer plan (Phase 1 → Phase 2)

ACTION: Include in PM interview at 18:50 UTC

================================================================================
END OF GUIDANCE
